# Day 3

The government is confused about how the social network behaves. It decides to invite the Chief Executive Officer of the social network before the GPSI (Governmental Panel for Serious Investigations), and asks her the following questions:

* How many data categories do you store, does THE NETWORK store, on the categories that you collect? How much? All of it? Everything we think? Is that in storage somewhere?
* In a world where there are $100 \times 100$ people in the world, and the probability of getting their minds changed is $p=0.7$, can you make sure that instead of one hour, a round of discussion only takes less than 0.1 ms?
* Is Twitter the same as what you do?
* At $p=0.76$, how does the probability that two people agree decay with the (Manhattan) distance between them? How about at $p=0.8$ and $p=0.7$?

Answer two of the above.
