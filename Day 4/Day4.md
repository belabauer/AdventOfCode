# Day 4

The government decides that social networks are not a good idea after all, but it has become so powerful that nobody can escape - everyone must scroll forever! After months of negotiations, the social network, now known as Thebes, agrees to let people go who can solve a riddle.

The challenge is to find the smallest even integer $L$ such that the Hamiltonian
$$
H = i \sum_{n=1}^{L-1} (|n\rangle\langle n+1| -|n+1\rangle\langle n| )
$$
has a smallest non-negative eigenvalue less than $1/\pi^3$.
